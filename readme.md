And last, if you want to change the sky color, make sure the "cloud" icon is active, and choose color.

### Saving and loading
Click the "Save" button to save your construction. A save window will appear, so you can navigate
to a location, where you want to save. No file extension is enforced so you can name your creations
whatever you want.
Use "Load" button to load a saved state, also note that no file extension is enforced so it's your responsibility to select correct file that was previously saved, otherwise the app will crash.
